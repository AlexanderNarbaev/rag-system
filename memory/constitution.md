# Project Constitution — rag-system

> Generated: 2026-08-10T10:20:42Z | Version: 1.0

## 1. Project Identity

**Name:** rag-system
**Purpose:** [Describe the primary goal of this project]
**Audience:** [Who is this for?]

## 2. Core Principles (MUST)

These principles are non-negotiable. All design and implementation decisions MUST align with them.

1. **Correctness over speed.** Code must be correct first. Performance optimizations come after correctness is verified.
2. **Explicit over implicit.** Behavior must be predictable from reading the code. No hidden side effects.
3. **Testable by design.** Every feature must have a clear testing strategy BEFORE implementation.
4. **Documented decisions.** All architectural decisions are recorded as ADRs in `docs/architecture/adr/`.

## 3. Recommended Practices (SHOULD)

These practices SHOULD be followed unless there is a documented reason not to.

1. **Use the SDD lifecycle:** constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → implement → verify → converge
2. **Spec-first:** Write specs before code. Specs live in `specs/` and are the source of truth.
3. **Small PRs:** Pull requests should be small (<400 lines) and focused on one concern.
4. **Automated verification:** Every PR must pass lint, type-check, tests, and security scan.

## 4. Technology Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | ADR |
|----------|-----------|------|-----|
| [Language/Platform] | [Why chosen] | 2026-08-10 | [ADR-001] |

## 5. SDD Lifecycle

This project follows the Specification-Driven Development (SDD) lifecycle:

```
constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → implement → verify → converge
     ↑                                                                        │
     └────────────────────── feedback loop ────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Phase | Purpose | Artifact |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Constitution** | Establish principles and constraints | `memory/constitution.md` |
| **Specify** | Define what to build | `specs/<feature>.md` |
| **Clarify** | Resolve ambiguities | `specs/<feature>.clarifications.md` |
| **Plan** | Break down into tasks | `.opencode/todo.md` |
| **Tasks** | Write atomic sub-tasks | `.opencode/todo.md` (M/T/S structure) |
| **Implement** | Build the code | Source files + tests |
| **Verify** | Test and review | Test results + review evidence |
| **Converge** | Polish and harden | `CHANGELOG.md` + release |

## 6. Governance Rules

- All code changes must go through the SDD lifecycle.
- Specs are reviewed BEFORE implementation begins.
- Constitution amendments require an ADR and review.
- Breaking changes require a migration plan.

## 7. Success Metrics

1. [Metric 1 — e.g., test coverage >80%]
2. [Metric 2 — e.g., PR review turnaround <24h]
3. [Metric 3 — e.g., zero P0 bugs in production]

> **Next:** Run `specify` phase to create your first spec.
